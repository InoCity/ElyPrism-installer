## Installation

After downloading the installer, run it with:

```bash
sh /path/to/ElyPrism.sh
```

The script will handle everything automatically (dependencies, setup, and execution), and **there is no need to run it from the terminal after installation** — it automatically creates a menu entry, so you can launch it from your system app menu.
